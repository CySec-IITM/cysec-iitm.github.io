We are a dedicated group of students who share a strong passion for computer and information security. Our primary goal is to introduce students to the fascinating field of cybersecurity and address complex challenges through research projects and collaborations with the industry.

What you can anticipate from our team:

- Active exploration and research in both well-established and cutting-edge areas of cybersecurity, often intersecting with other related fields.
- We focus on solving real-world problems across diverse domains, including binary exploitation, cryptography, file forensics, web server exploitation, hardware exploitation, and more.
- Through informative sessions and Capture The Flag (CTF) events, we aim to assist the student community in embarking on their cybersecurity journey and encouraging them to dive deeper into this exciting domain.
